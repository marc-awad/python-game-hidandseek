# 🎮 Chase The Enemy

A simple Python game built with **Pygame** where you control the player to catch moving enemies within a limited time.

## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows Command Prompt:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux terminal:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

The virtual environment allows you to have a project-specific Python setup.

To exit the virtual environment, use:
```bash
deactivate
```

## 📦 Managing Dependencies

To save installed dependencies to a file:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

To install dependencies from a file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎮 How to Play
